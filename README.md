# Which Is Better For Vietnamese Named Entity Recognition: Features or Embeddings?

With the move from traditional machine learning to neural network models, the emphasis on feature engineering has been diminished accordingly. It is often claimed that the neural networks can learn directly from the dataset the information needed for the task at hand.
In this paper, we seek to understand the power of the neural networks by exploring whether handcrafted features still have a role in the area of deep learning through Named Entity Recognition task for Vietnamese language. The results show that, though the model architecture is indeed crucial, the word embeddings are not necessarily superior to handcrafted features.
